### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to use the OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify Routing APIs in combination with various Python 3 modules to plan and visualize a prospective vacation trip constituting a loop between 4 hotels in 4 different cities within a country.  These locations were determined by user input, specifically, temperature range preference.
